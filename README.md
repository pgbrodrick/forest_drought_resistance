Accompanying data can be accessed from Pangaea at the native 30 m resolution at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.897276 .

Use of data or code should cite the above manuscript.  We also recommend the following manuscripts relevent to CWC:

P.G. Brodrick and G.P. Asner. Remotely sensed predictors of conifer tree mortality duringsevere drought.Environmental Research Letters, 12(11), 2017. doi: 10.1088/1748-9326/aa8f55.

T. Paz-Kagan, P.G. Brodrick, N.R. Vaughn, A.J. Das, N.L. Stephenson, K.R. Nydick, and G.P. Asner. What mediates tree mortality during drought in the southern Sierra Nevada? Ecological Applications, 2017. doi: 10.1002/eap.1620.

G.P. Asner, P.G. Brodrick, C.B. Anderson, N.R. Vaughn, D.E. Knapp, and R.E. Martin. Progressive forest canopy water loss during the 2012–2015 California drought. Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences, 113(2):E249–E255, 2016. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1523397113.

Data has been pre-processed to 4 km tiles (as used in the manuscript), along with the corresponding meteorological data, in the folders that end with dat_4km.

The files map_figures.py and nomap_figures.py produce the principal figures for the manuscript. The subfolder model contains the code to train the CWC model (described in the manuscript SI), and requires accompanying environmental data to apply.

Please get in touch with questions or concerns.
